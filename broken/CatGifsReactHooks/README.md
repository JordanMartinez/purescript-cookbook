# CatGifsReactHooks

A React port of the ["HTTP - Cat GIFs" Elm Example](https://elm-lang.org/examples/cat-gifs).

Broken due to upgrading package set to `psc-0.13.8-20200716`.

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

The browser will display "Loading..." and then display a cat GIF with a button that will display the next random cat GIF if the HTTP request succeeds or an error message along with the same button if it fails.

## Dependencies Used:

[react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
[react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
