# Broken

This folder stores recipes that worked/compiled at one time and then were later broken by one of the following:
- a new PureScript release that includes breaking changes
- a new package set release where one of the recipes' dependencies included breaking changes
- a new package set release that dropped one of the recipes' dependencies

While these recipes may be "broken," it might not take much work to get them working again. So, consider updating them and then moving them back to the `recipes` folder or viewing these as unmaintained documentation.
