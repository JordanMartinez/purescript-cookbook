## Contributing new recipes

Follow these instructions for contributing new recipes:
1. Pick an existing recipe to duplicate as a starting point. The `Template` recipe is probably the simplest".
1. Rename the copied folder to a short description of the problem you're trying to solve using PascalCase (e.g. RoutingPushHalogen)
1. If your recipe is incompatible with the browser enviornment (e.g. reading local files with node), delete the `dev` directory. Note that just logging to the console **is** supported in the browser.
1. Use your recipe name to prefix all modules. Do a quick search to find all instances of the old recipe name to replace (e.g. `grep -r RoutingPushHalogen .`).
1. If needed, update the `packages.dhall` file to include more packages.
1. Install needed dependencies via `spago install <packageName>`
1. Implement your recipe
1. Rember to update your recipe's readme
1. Submit a PR
