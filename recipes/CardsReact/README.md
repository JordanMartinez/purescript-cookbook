# CardsReact

A React port of the ["Random - Cards" Elm Example](https://elm-lang.org/examples/cards).

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

If the user clicks the "Draw" button, a random card will be displayed. **Note:** the Elm example uses a uniform generator whereas this example does not because PureScript does not have an out-of-box uniform generator.

## Dependencies Used:

[react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
[react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
