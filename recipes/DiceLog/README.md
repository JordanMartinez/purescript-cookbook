# DiceLog

This recipe shows how to log a random integer between 1 and 6 (representing a roll of a die) in either the node.js or web browser console.

## Expected Behavior:

### Node.js

Prints the message `You rolled:` followed by a random integer between 1 and 6 to the console.

### Browser

Prints the message `You rolled:` followed by a random integer between 1 and 6 to the console when the page is loaded.

Make sure to open the console with dev tools first, then reload/refresh the page.
