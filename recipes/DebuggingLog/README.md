# DebuggingLog

This recipe shows how to do print-debugging using the `Debug` module's `spy` and `traceM` functions. The compiler will emit warnings to remind you to remove these debug functions before you ship production code.

## Expected Behavior:

Does console-printing-based debugging in various contexts to show the pros/cons of each approach and how reliable/unpredictable they can be.

For the browser, make sure to open the console with dev tools first, then reload/refresh the page.
