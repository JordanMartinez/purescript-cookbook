# ComponentsMultiTypeReactHooks

Demonstrates a parent component with several children components, each with different prop types.

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

A toggle button, a count button, and an input field are the children of the parent. The user can modify the state of any of those inputs and then click the "Check now" button. This will update the most recent observed state.
The parent will also display how many times it has been rendered.
