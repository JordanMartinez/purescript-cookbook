# GroceriesJs

A framework-free port of the ["HTML - Groceries" Elm Example](https://elm-lang.org/examples/groceries).

Note that this example involves some lower-level DOM manipulation, so it's generally preferred to use a framework instead.

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

The browser will display a header of text and an unordered list of grocery items.
