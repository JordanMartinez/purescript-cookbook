# BigInts

This recipe shows how to create and use `BigInt` from [`purescript-bigints`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-bigints/).

## Expected Behavior:

Whether on Node or the Browser, this recipe will print a few BigInts to the console. If on the browser, open the console with dev tools. If you don't see anything, reload/refresh the page.
