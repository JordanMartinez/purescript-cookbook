  = Anticlockwise
  | Clockwise

-- | When we get the set of currently-pressed keys, we'll want to figure out

-- | stream of desired controls.

controls keyboard
  = map keysToControls (keys keyboard)

-- | Given that we're maybe making a move, we need to convert this move into a
-- | "velocity". Honestly, I couldn't think of a better word for this: we're
-- | trying to express, per second, how many full clockwise rotations the
-- | cursor can do.  A negative number means we'll move anticlockwise.

{- MAIN -}

-- | The application loop uses some weird-looking functions. Here, we're
-- | getting the _fixed point_ of a state stream. What this really means is,
-- | we're going to calculate each iteration of state using the one before it.
-- | Of course, we'll also need the current time and the controls the user has
-- | pressed. lift3 takes an `a -> b -> c -> d` function and transforms it into
-- | a `Behavior a -> Behavior b -> Behavior c -> Behavior d` function. Here,
-- | we only apply two of those to `update` - `seconds` and `controls`. The
-- | third argument is the state stream, so we can access previous state.

loop :: Keyboard -> Behavior State
loop keyboard
  = fixB initialState (lift3 update seconds (controls keyboard))

-- | Once we've got a stream of state updates, we can just apply each iteration
-- | to the `paint` function to get each frame of our animation. `map` takes an
-- | `a -> b` and transforms it into a `Behavior a -> Behavior b` function.

renderLoop :: Keyboard -> Behavior Drawing
renderLoop keyboard
  = map paint (loop keyboard)

-- | The `main` function is our application's entry point: this is the function
-- | that gets executed to run our javascript, so everything must stem from
-- | here :)
