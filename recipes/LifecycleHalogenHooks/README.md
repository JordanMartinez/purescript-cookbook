# LifecycleHalogenHooks

Demonstrates component lifecycle.

## Expected Behavior:

A three-level component tree (root, child, cell) will report when each element is initialized and finalized. Parent components will re-report what their children report to show control flow. User can add/remove/reverse children in this example.
