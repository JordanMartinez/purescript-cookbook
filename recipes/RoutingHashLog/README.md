### Quick Start
From the top repo directory, run:
```
npm run build
npm run serve --cookbook:recipe=RoutingHashLog
```

Then open up the browser console, and click on the links.
You should see the anchor in the URL change, and the route changes logged in the console.

You may also edit the URL directly instead of clicking on the links.
