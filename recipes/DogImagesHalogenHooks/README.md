# CatGifsHalogenHooks

A Halogen port of the (now defunct) ["HTTP - Cat GIFs" Elm Example](https://elm-lang.org/examples/cat-gifs), refactored to use the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

The browser will display "Loading..." and then display a dog image with a button that will display the next random dog image if the HTTP request succeeds or an error message along with the same button if it fails.
