### Quick Start
From the top repo directory, run:
```
npm run build
npm run serve --cookbook:recipe=RoutingHashHalogen
```

When you click on the links, you should see:
* The anchor in the URL change
* The current route rendered on the page
* Route changes logged to the dev console

You may also edit the URL directly instead of clicking on the links.
