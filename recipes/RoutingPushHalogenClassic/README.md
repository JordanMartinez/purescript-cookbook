# RoutingPushHalogenClassic

This recipe shows how to use `purescript-routing` to do client-side push-state routing in a Halogen-based single-page application (SPA).

## Expected Behavior:

### Browser

When you click on the links, you should see:
* The URL change
* The current route rendered on the page
* Route changes logged to the dev console

You may also edit the URL directly instead of clicking on the links.
